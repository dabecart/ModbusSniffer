# Modbus_Sniffer
This is as simple as it can get! A basic MODBUS sniffer created to test some prototypes while I was working on Airzone. In reality it can be used to read any kind of serial UART transmission, but it was specifically made for MOSBUS. It can read single registers or in blocks and write with or without masks.
